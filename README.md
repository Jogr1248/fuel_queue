# ⛽ Fuel Reservation Management System
The Fuel Reservation Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline fuel booking and queue management for users across multiple stations. Built with Java (Servlets + JSP), MySQL, and hosted on a Tomcat server, the system allows registered users to reserve fuel, view availability, and manage their profiles — while admins monitor reservations and system data.
